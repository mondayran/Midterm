    <h1>Winter is better</h1>
    <p>
      Cozy Comfort: Winter offers a unique sense of coziness. You can enjoy warm
      blankets, hot chocolate, and the comfort of sitting by a fireplace. The
      chilly weather makes indoor activities like reading, baking, or movie
      marathons even more enjoyable.
